# Book Recommendation System

Recommendation Types:

* Content base Filters : Based on properties of content that user select ( bases on same user only)

* Collaborative  Filters :

  - There are two classes of Collaborative Filtering:

    - User-based, which measures the similarity between target users and other users,if number of user is limited (like message you see 'user who select this item is also select the-following items').

    - Item-based, which measures the similarity between the items that target users rate or interact with and other items, if number of items is limited.
